GJ - did all the work, helped me understand the 3d space, vector and matrix operations and quaternions, also had a challenge with coding the shaders and the perlin noise, and a hierachichal tree like seen in game engines

The other one - worked on the boat movement, cameras, collision detection and response, shaders (blinn-phong model, lights, planar shadows, reflections, textures, transparency), boat respawn, game over and pause features and UI

P3D - did the entire algorithm, in both cpu and gpu versions
