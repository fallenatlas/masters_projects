### Hi there! üëã

### :man_technologist: About Me :

I'm Tiago Antunes, currently I'm doing my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior T√©cnico, Lisbon. I am specializing in Videogames and Interaction and Visualization, and aim to land a job in the game industry as a programmer for games.

I'm a very creative person at heart. I've been exposed to things like games and tech from a very young age which has made me particularly interested in them. More recently photography uncovered an interest in story telling and visuals I didn't know I had.

I love working on games! I've been working on some personal projects and exploring the gameplay side of games more than anything. I particularly strive to give the best game feel and mechanics to players!

I'm a calm, laid back person, who turns into an energy ball that easily spreads when I'm excited about what I'm doing. I'm also very ambitious and hard working, constantly looking to learn something new and ways to improve myself and my craft.

Since 2022 I have been part of GameDev T√©cnico, a student association focused on game development. Here I have developed a game engine and worked on multiple games with multidisciplinary teams. My experience regarding game development is mainly focused on programming but I also do some design. I have done games both in 2D and 3D, mainly using Godot as a game engine, and C++ is my most used language.

Here are some of the projects I consider to have learned more from:

### üßä Cubos (Engine)
Cubos is a voxel based game engine in C++/OpenGL, with an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. I've been working on it since Dec 2022.

When the opportunity came, I started the physics plugin (each funcionality of the engine is divided into plugins), which I always had interest in, and started working on narrow phase collision detection, since at this point we only had a rudimentary broad phase. Since then, a lot of research on physics and design, to how the physics in our engine should be, was done. I've implemented two different collision solvers, initially XPBD and currently an impulse solver. Currently, we have working collisions for box shapes and voxel shapes, full rigid body simulation for these shapes, and different physics materials.

Recently, with the expansion of the project, and restructuring into teams, I've been guiding the development of the physics and collisions for the engine. Currently, the team is composed of three members, for whom I manage and review the work. I also represent the team in general meetings, with the lead of the project, and I'm the contact point for any issues regarding these areas of the engine. The development is in full force with a cycle of new releases every 3 months approximately.

This project has deeply improved my skills in working with version control (git), leading, teamwork, and research, beyond being a great opportunity to improve my knowledge of C++.

### ‚≠ê Star Project (Game)
This is a new project and intends on being a fast paced 2D top-down roguelite, with elemental abilities (inspired in the likes of Avatar: The last airbender), fully built in Godot.
For this project so far I've developed player controls for movement and aiming, for controller and keyboard & mouse (which automatically switch depending on the input), combat mechanics, player HUD and skill tree UI. I'm also a designer for this game.

This project does not **yet** have a publicly available page.

### ü¶∏ Immortal Journey (Game)
This game was designed for a course, from scratch, taking inspiration from a movie. We had a short developement frame (3 months).
For this game I worked on player resources, player movement, player attack, player HUD, tutorial, initial cutscene, world switching (both of physical world, and enemy behavior), and basic enemy movement.
Our team also worked alongside a audio student from another school who produced the sounds for the game.

This was my first dive into a full development of a bigger game in a short time frame, which was very challenging, working with a multidisciplinary team.

### üì± Conception Centered in the User (CCU) and Studio of Design and Interaction (DIIC) (App Prototypes)
For these courses we where tasked with developing prototypes for apps. 

For CCU we were challenged by Santander (a bank) to design a finantial advise app (mainly for smartphones). We focused heavily on the look and functionality of the app, according to the user research. I mainly worked as a designer in building the figma prototype.

**Final Prototype**: https://www.figma.com/proto/meuIV7BFqZSioRLSqEh1X1/CCU-%E2%80%A2-SantanderAssistant?node-id=210-2408&starting-point-node-id=210%3A2408&t=Dh55e9b8uiaJCcQS-1

**Pitch**: https://www.canva.com/design/DAF2mw02TDI/RviLTi3JgzxfpaqVFnjdJg/view?utm_content=DAF2mw02TDI&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h211fb466a1

For DIIC we where tasked to look for a problem to solve for minory groups. We chose to tackle the problem of diagnosing colorblindness for children since it was the problem we found during our research (by interviewing colorblind people). Our solution was an app for kids that could diagnose colorblindness in a gamified way, played in tablets or computers. For this project I acted as the project manager and I additionally developed almost the entirety of the figma prototype.

**Final Prototype**: https://www.figma.com/proto/2c1YTYidyxcxXrJV5lg77q/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=ZPzc4wOoLXwQHbhp-1

Both of these projects involved user research (both secondary, and with interviews and other methods), learning design techniques to make things appealing and functional, and using AGILE methodologies.

### Computer Graphics for Games
For this course I developed a small "engine like" program. It was fully developed in C++ and OpenGL by me and includes: realistic lighting (blinn-phong model), procedurally generated textures (3D) of marble and wood using perling noise, orbital camera, a hierachical scene graph, mouse picking, movement of objects with mouse in multiple axis (including rotation) like seen in engines, and serialization of the scene in JSON.

This project helped me get better with C++ (and C), and better understand 3D space, vector and matrix operations and quaternions. It was also a good introduction to programming shaders.

### üåÉ Tridimensional Visualization
For this course we developed a small game using C++ and OpenGL.
I developed the boat movement, cameras, collision detection and response, shaders (blinn-phong model, lights, planar shadows, reflections, textures, transparency), HUD, game over and pause features.

This project further developed my C++ skills, and my knowledge in shaders, particularly having more advanced shaders with more features that need to communicate with the main program and using the stencil buffer.

### üêç HakSLAD (Game)
This was a project I worked on to get familiar with the godot engine in about a month. The main challenge for this project was the player character, a "snake" that expands and gets cut where the lasers hit it. I implemented multiple levels, and for each kept a scoreboard for the best scores. This is also the game with the most complex UI of all my projects, and was where I spent a significant amount of time as well. For this game I also implemented a different game mode where two players fight each other.

### üî¶ 3D Programming
For this project we implemented raytracing algorithms for CPU (Turner Whitted) in C++ and for GPU (progressive) in GLSL. I developed the majority of the algorithms. Additionally I also developed a BVH tree for optimizing collision detection between rays and the objects in scene in C++.

### ü§ñ Artificial Inteligence for Games
Worked on several common AI algorithms for games and game playing, such as (Hierarchichal) State Machines, behavious trees, Q-learning and MCTS.
