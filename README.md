Make an about me section

Hi hi, I prefer to talk through actions and I don't like to talk much about myself but you have an interest so here we go.

I'm a very creative person at heart. I've been exposed to things like games and tech from a very young age which has made me particularly interested in them and more recently photography uncovered an interest in story telling and visuals I didn't know I had.

I'm currently in the process of learning about games, interactivity and visualization and I just gotta say... I love working on games! I've been working on some personal projects and exploring the gameplay side of games more than anything but giving the players an engaging story, making them think through new perspectives and giving them an unforgetable gameplay experience are all things I strive for!

I'm a calm, laid back person, who turns into an energy ball that easily spreads when I'm excited about what I'm doing. I'm also very ambitious and hard working, constantly looking to learn something new and ways to improve myself and my craft. I do not like pushy people. I will, however, go out of my way to help those who are nice and have earned my respect.


## Cubos
Cubos is a voxel based game engine in C++/OpenGL, with an Entity Component System (ECS) architecture. I've been working on it since Dec 2022. Initially I started as a demo developer, but eventually I started working on the engine, my first task was calculating the delta time between frames.

When the opportunity came, I started the physics plugin (each funcionality of the engine is divided into plugins), which I always had interest in, and started working on narrow phase collision detection, since at this point we only had a rudimentary broad phase. Since then, a lot of research on physics and design to how the physics in our engine should be was done. I've implemented two different collision solvers, initially XPBD and currently an impulse solver. Currently, we have working collisions for box shapes and voxel shapes, full rigid body simulation for these shapes, and different physics materials.

Recently, with the expansion of the project, and restructuring into teams, I've been guiding the development of the physics and collisions for the engine. Currently, the team is composed of three members, for whom I manage and review the work. I also represent the team in general meeting, with the lead of the project, and I'm the contact point for any issues regarding these areas of the engine.

This project has severely improved my skills in working with version control (git), leading, teamwork, and research, beyond being a great opportunity to improve my skills in C++.

## Star Project
This is a new project and intends on being a fast paced 2D top-down roguelite, with elemental abilities (inspired in the likes of Avatar: The last airbender), fully built in Godot.
For this project I've so far developed player controls for movement and aiming, for controller and keyboard & mouse, which automatically switch depending on the input, combat mechanics, player HUD and skill tree UI.

This project does not **yet** have a publicly available page.

## Immortal Journey
This game was designed for a course, from scratch, taking inspiration from a movie. We had a short developement frame (3 months).
For this game I worked on player resources, player movement, player attack, player HUD, tutorial, initial cutscene, world switching (both of physical world, and enemy behavior), and basic enemy movement.

Our team also worked alongside a audio student from another school who produced the sounds for the game.

This was my first dive into a full development of a bigger game in a short time frame, which was very challenging, working with a multidisciplinary team.

## CGJ
GJ - did all the work, helped me understand the 3d space, vector and matrix operations and quaternions, also had a challenge with coding the shaders and the perlin noise, and a hierachichal tree like seen in game engines

For this course I developed a small "engine like" program. It was fully developed in C++ and OpenGL by me and includes: realistic lighting (blinn-phong model), procedurally generated textures (3D) of marble and wood using perling noise, orbital camera, a hierachical scene graph like seen in game engines, mouse picking, movement of objects with mouse in multiple axis (including rotation) like seen in engines too, and serialization of the scene in JSON.
This project helped me get better with C++ (and C), and better understand 3D space, vector and matrix operations and quaternions. It was also a good introduction to programming shaders.

## AVT
AVT - worked on the boat movement, cameras, collision detection and response, shaders (blinn-phong model, lights, planar shadows, reflections, textures, transparency), boat respawn, game over and pause features and UI
For this course we developed a small game using C++ and OpenGL.

Also worked on the BVH tree to optimize collision detection
